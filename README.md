# MyRockApp

To test the app just open the visual studio solution and run it with the API project as startup project.

The projects use .NET 6.0 so this runtime is required to run the app.

In the postman collections folder there is a postman collection which you can use to call the finished API function.
API functions that are in the code but not in the collection are not ready for use yet.
